        <p>
            My name is Matt King and I've been involved with computers and programming since the summer of 1984. 
            Prior to my 8th grade when I went to Cincinnati with my cousins to Computer Camp at 
            <a href="http://www.msj.edu/">Mount St. Joseph University</a>. My first Program was in BASIC on an 
            Atari Computer and 
            on a 5 <sup>1/4</sup> inch floppy disk.

        </figure>
        <p>  
            Since then I've worked with computers primarily in the <a href="http://www.navy.mil">US Navy</a> as an 
            <a href="https://www.navycs.com/navy-jobs/operations-specialist.html">Operations Specialist</a> (OS) 
            and at the <a href="http://www.tampagov.net">City of Tampa</a> as an Applications Systems Analyst and Senior Programmer 
            Analyst.  In between I've worked doing several jobs as a developer/programmer at 
            <a href="http://www.ersgroup.com/">Economic Research Services (ERS Group)</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.akingump.com/en/index.html">Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP</a> and 
            <a href="https://www.usaajobs.com/">United States Automobile Association (USAA)</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I majored in Computer Science, Computer Programming, Information Technology and Data Science at several schools including 
            <a href="http://xavier.edu">Xavier University</a> (Pascal),
            <a href="http://uc.edu">University of Cincinnati</a> (C++, Mathematica, Fortran, LISP, Prolog), 
            <a href="http://utsa.edu">University of Texas at San Antonio</a> (C, Java), 
            <a href="http://alamo.edu/sac">San Antonio College</a> (Visual Basic, Unix scripting),
            <a href="http://www.tcc.fl.edu">Tallahassee Community College</a> (Visual Basic, Java), 
            <a href="http://www.hccfl.edu">Hillsborough Community College </a>(Web Development, Perl, PHP, mySQL) and 
            <a href="http://www.usf.edu">University of South Florida</a> (C#, Java, Python, Technical Writing).
        </p>
        <p>
            I also spend a lot of my time taking various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC </a>courses via <a href="http://coursera.org">Coursera.org</a>  
            and <a href="edx.org">EdX.org</a> in particular the Data Science and Programming 
            fields so I can keep my skills somewhat fresh.  I attend several meetups in the Tampa Bay and Orlando areas, as well as, annual Code Camps, 
            SQL Saturdays, IT Pro Camps, Xamarin Dev Days and Hackathons.  I also try to blog about technology on my 
            <a href="http://mattkingit.com/blogs">Matt King IT</a> website I created with WordPress.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from computers I really enjoy professional wrestling and going to the movies.  Some of my favorite wrestlers are "Mr. Perfect" 
            Curt Hennig, "Ravishing" Rick Rude, "The Ultimate Warrior", Kevin Owens and "Macho Man" Randy Savage.  Some of my favorite movies 
            are "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures", "Back to the Future", "Dogma", "What's Eating Gilbert Grape","Natural Born Killers" and "Space Balls".  I mostly prefer action movies but am not 
            to picky, I just like to have that escape every now and then.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh yeah, I also did a Technical Review for Ken Doman's book <u>"Mastering ArcGIS Server Development with JavaScript"</u>. You 
            can get the book on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-ArcGIS-Server-Development-JavaScript/dp/1784396451">Amazon.com</a> 
            or <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-arcgis-server-development-javascript">Packt Publishing</a> website.

                    I was co-enrolled in Hillsborough Community College (HCC) and University
                    of South Florida (USF) Tampa and Lakeland, now Florida Polytechnic, from 
                    January 2003 until I graduated from USF with my Bachelor of Science in IT.

                    At HCC I took several classes in IT and similar like Game Development, Networking, 
                    AutoCADD, ArcGIS, Perl & CGI, PHP and Web Authoring with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

                    At USF I finished up my major with classes in Project Management, Java, Python, 
                    Technical Writing and my Senior Project.

                    Upon moving from Cincinnati to San Antonio, I was co-enrolled at San Antonio Community

                    classes in Java including Data Structures. At SAC I took Unix scripting and Web Development 
                    but moved in the middle of the semester to Tallahassee.

                    After a year off of school to become a Florida resident I then pursued my AA in Computer 
                    Programming taking classes in Visual Basic and database classes in Oracle. I received my 
                    Associates Degree in Computer Programming in December 2007.

                    After doing four years of Active Duty I returned to Cincinnati to continue pursuing my 
                    Computer Science degree at the University of Cincinnati using my GI Bill.
                    
                    Some of the computer classes I took included Introduction to Computer Science and Data Structures 
                    with C++ and C.  I also took classes in Fortran, Mathematica, LISP and Prolog.
